# X1C6-Hack
Based on Tyler Nguyen's work, this is his X1C6 EFI with a few additions for OC87

First, let's be perfectly clear:  Tyler did 99.5% of the work - the hard part.  I'm testing with Ventura, I'm testing with OC87, and I'm testing with some more kexts, and I'm applying a few of my updates.  That's it.  The development, the ACPI stuff, the difficult stuff - that's ALL TYLER.  To see the master at work, hop over to his repository https://github.com/tylernguyen/x1c6-hackintosh and his own site https://tylernguyen.github.io/x1c6-hackintosh/.  

Again, Tyler's work.  I'm updating a few things for my convenience, and sharing it to others.  That's it.  If you want to buy someone a coffee, make sure it's Tyler; it's awesome!
